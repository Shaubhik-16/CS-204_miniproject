## Assembly To Machine Code Translation

A C++ program using oops which can convert a RISC – V assembly code to its corresponding Machine Code along with Data Memory. Here is the link for RISC – V simulator https://venus.cs61c.org/ . All conversion is based on formats present in RISC – V Reference Sheet available in Project.

## Test Cases

## Support

The Project currently supports most of the instructions available in format.txt file .
## Built With/ Concepts Used
• C ++ ,oops 
• RISC – V (32-Bit Architecture)

## How to build program (In Compiler)
• Type following
-> Place the code to translate in input.asm File
-> Compile main.cpp
-> Output will be produced in output.mc File
-> output.mc has Machine Code in Hexadecimal Form with Program Counter followed by Data Memory Part.
